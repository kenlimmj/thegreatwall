    "answer": {
        "content": "To clear this concept up, let's relook at what the LRAC is. \n\nhttp://www.openlectures.org/lessons/costs-in-the-long-run#/0\n\nThis lecture explains what the LRAC is. Now the MES is simply the bottom point of the LRAC, where the firm minimizes its long run costs. To say that a firm has larger MES simply means that for one particular firm, the bottom point of his LRAC occurs at a higher quantity. The MES shows the point where the firm is achieving the most economies of scale. So think of this example.\n\nSay there's a hawker uncle. His optimum size is probably two hawker stalls at the very most. That will be around $10K worth of revenue a month? But for a factory to produce cars in Japan, they will need much more than $10K worth of revenue. In fact, the number should be on the millions. Hence it means that the LRAC either stretched (such that the MES is at a higher quantity) or that it experienced a rightward shift.\n\nA downward shift of the LRAC doesn't indicate a larger MES. Instead, it indicates that at the MES (remember that the MES is a QUANTITY, not the cost), at the quantity where the factory is operating at lowest costs, it can now operate at an even lower cost. So imagine that for the car factory, it's long run cost at MES was originally $100 million. Now, because Toyota invented some awesome technology, the cost is now $50million. Its LRAC will then shift down."

There doesn't seem to be a trend in where I lose my marks- I did very well for case studies at the start of last year but in the recently concluded exams my case studies pulled me down quite a bit. I was wondering what's the best and most effective way to study for Econs for the upcoming Prelims? Thank you!",
    "answer": {
        "content": "For case studies, you have to first realise where you're losing most of your marks to determine the appropriate response strategy. Case study questions can be generally split into the short 2,4,6 mark questions and the longer 8 or 10 or even 12 mark questions. Firstly let's start by analysing that you have 2hr 15 mins for the case study paper and you have two case study questions, each 30 marks, so try not to spend more than 2 minutes per mark (trust me you'll need the extra 15 minutes to READ AL YOUR SOURCES and if possible write a nice conclusion for your 8/10/12 mark questions). For the 2/4/6 mark questions they are usually about simple state/explain questions. For state questions, give the general trend and one anomaly; if it's a compare question, give one similarity and one difference. Thats the 2 mark questions settled. To tackle the 4/6 mark questions which require explaining, you need to have done your homework well, literally, because all your practices and studying should help reinfored economic concepts in your head (if not, then back to the books). USe the information in your head to explain what the question wants and remember: THIS IS A CASE STUDY so please quote source material to support your explanations for example, instead of stating the reason for a rise in demand 'change in consumers' tastes and preferences' give  evidence, source A states 'Consumers now prefer cute yellow things' which shows a change in consuemrs' tastes and preferences leading to the rise in demand for Despicable Me toys. Try to give reasons from both sides of the fence, e.g. both supply and demand reasons instead of just demand. For the 8-12 mark case study questions, try to tackle it like a mini-essay, give definitions at the start, proceed to make a balanced argument where you list factos from both sides of the fence and EXPLAIN each factor and how it's relevant to the question, using ECONOMIC framework (e.g. Source A mentions that 'Birth rates are dropping tremendously in east Asian countries..' therefore, this shows a change in the population factor which affects the demand of childcare services, ceteris paribus....). For such questions, it is best to give a short conclusion and evaluate the argument on both sides and eventually pass judgement. (e.g. Consumers' taste and preference for Hello Kitties are likely to be just a passing fad as seen from Source B 'Consumers forget Hello Kitties in the rush for Despicable Me toys', hence in the long run, such taste and preferences are less likely to affect demand for Hello Kitties. To prepare for your upcoming Prelims, it's just practice and practice but make sure you get someone qualified i.e. your tutor to evaluate your work so you can learn from your mistakes, if at any point you're unsure of cretain concepts, don't hesitate and go back to your notes IMMEDIATELY and only return to practicing once you're sure you've understood and memorised the concept well."

        "content": "You're right in saying that MR=DD. But first degree price discrimination is one of those places where the AR is kind of a mindf***. \n\nNow let's look at the normal case first. You see, your demand curve shows the price that consumers are willing to pay at each quantity right? So let's say I'm selling Teh Bing at $1 each when the quantity demanded is 1000 per day. AR is AVERAGE revenue, ie. revenue divided by quantity. It is the revenue you earn from each cup of Teh Bing, which is simply the price of the Teh Bing. In other words, the DD curve, which shows the price at each quantity, simply shows the average revenue at every quantity as well. Average Revenue and price are simply two terms for the same thing.\n\nBut what happens when you have first degree price discrimination? Let's say for the first customer, I charged $4. For the second, I charged $3. For the third, I charged $2. Now you'd be at $2 for MR right? But that's not your AR! Your AR is (4+3+2) / 3  = $3. In fact, you're right! It is a line outside DD that has half the gradient. This is one of those few times when the DD and the AR are not the same, simply because you are not changing a single price for your products!"

    "content": "Hi, can I ask why the demand curve is often shown to be equal to the marginal revenue curve? Is it possible for these two curves to be different?",
    "answer": {
        "content": "The demand curve is RARELY the marginal revenue curve! Now the demand curve is often NOT the marginal revenue curve, and the two curves are only the same for first degree price discrimination and perfect competition.\n\nDon't memorize these. Let's derive everything. Let's talk about the demand curve first. Let's say I'm selling Teh Bing for $1 when the quantity demanded is 1000. I sell it for $2, when the quantity demanded is 500. If you have many many such points, you get your demand curve right? Now at quantity 1000, my revenue is $1000, since I multiply the price ($1) with the quantity (1000). So my revenue is $1000. What is my average revenue? I simply take the revenue divided by quantity. So my Average Revenue (AR) = $1. But look! Since AR = total revenue / quantity, then it's by definition the same thing as price! So AR always equals to price. And since the demand curve shows the relationship between price and quantity, the AR curve is always equal to the demand curve.\n\nNow what about the marginal revenue (MR)? It is the revenue you earn with an additional unit. By calculus, it is d(Total Revenue)/dQ, but there's an intuitive understanding of that as well. Most of the time, the MR is not equal to the AR, since your AR is downward sloping. Think of it this way. If you sell 1 pokemon card a day, they go for $10. If you sell 2, they go for $9. The marginal revenue is (9*2 - 10) = 8, but the average revenue is $9. Now if you sell 3, they go for $8. The marginal revenue is (8*3 - 18 ) = 6. The average revenue is $8.\n\nHowever, if you have perfect competition, then your demand curve is entirely horizontal. What that means is that you can only charge one price, say $1 for Milos. In that case, the price of a milo (DD), is always at $1. That means your price is always at $1, hence your average revenue is $1. Since the additional revenue earned by one cup of Milo is only $1, then your MR is always $1 as well. Hence, MR = AR = DD for perfect competition.\n\nWhat about if you have multiple prices? In that case, MR = DD, but DD no longer equals to AR. Let's say for the first customer, I charged $4. For the second, I charged $3. For the third, I charged $2. Now you'd be at $2 for MR right? But that's not your AR! Your AR is (4+3+2) / 3  = $3. In fact, you're right! It is a line outside DD that has half the gradient. This is one of those few times when the DD and the AR are not the same, simply because you are not changing a single price for your products!\n\nMoral of the story? Always understand first before memorizing rules!"

Let's say you want really good cookies, so you borrow $200 from me. Now you owe me $200 dollars, and you write me a little piece of paper that says \"Tah Ah Kow owes openlectures $200 dollars for cookies.\" Now let's say I have lots of people buying cookies, and they all borrow money, and they all write me little pieces of paper. I take these paper, put them into a big pile, then tear them into little pieces. I sell these little pieces of paper to people who want to invest in people who borrowed money to buy cookies. So lots of people have these tiny pieces of paper.\n\nWhy do they want to do this? Well imagine a situation where cookies keep increasing in prices. So Tan Ah Kow, who borrowed money to buy say 100 cookies, can simply wait for the prices of cookies to increase (till $3 per piece), sell them, and buy more cookies, sell them, and buy more. This only happens when the price of cookies keep increasing. Then the other people who invested in Tan Ah Kow by buying his pieces of paper can expect to be repaid (handsomely usually with insane amounts of extra money.) openlectures, who sits in the middle being a bank, simply plays the role of a middle man and scoops off whatever money they can get.\n\nBut what if prices of cookies decrease? Tan Ah Kow will find that his cookies are now worth a lot less and he won't be able to sell off his cookies and get more money. Then he won't be able to repay his debt to me. A whole string of defaults (basically what happens when people can't pay up) happens, everyone's value shrinks (since cookies are just worth a lot less).

In fact, it can be proven via algebra that half the range of Qs given by AR will result in a negative MR. In other words, if AR goes from Q = 0 to Q = 100, then Q = 50 to Q = 100 will have negative MR.\n\nIn that case, the monopoly will not produce when Q > 50, prefering strictly to produce when Q < 50. \n\nMonopolies do \"prefer\" inelastic demands. In fact, the very nature of a monopoly begs for a inelastic demand, and they reinforce their inelastic demand. However, there will always be a region where MR > 0 for the monopolies to produce at. It may be a portion that is relatively elastic, but remember that monopolies don't produce based on the elasticity!

Simply put, they have different MES because they produce different things, which makes their cost conditions different.

In turn, this produces different MESes.\n\nImagine you have a giant factory producing laptops, while I am a neighborhood pokemon card dealer. Your economies of scale come when you order material in bulk, specialize your workers, and use giant equipments to speed up bulk production. Hence, your MES sets in when you produce millions of computers. What about me? My economies of scale happen when I have around 20 clients. Beyond which, I will be flooded by requests daily for Surfing Pikachus. This will cause diseconomies of scale.

    "answer": {
        "content": "I see that you have been reading Wikipedia! Let me try to explain the multiple things that happened in that paragraph in the most straightforward way I can manage.\n\nPut in the most simple way, the collapse of the thai baht entailed a extreme devaluation, i.e. the thai baht lost most of its value as a currency in the forex market.\n\n‘Float the currency’ means that the thai government was forced to leave the price of the thai baht to pure market forces. (I assume some h2 knowledge on the different systems of exchange rate determination, i.e. free float, managed float, fixed etc. You can watch Cynthia’s videos here http://www.openlectures.org/topics/exchange-rate-policy)\n\nWhy let it float? Realise that the situation was that people were letting go of large quantities of the baht on the forex market, and you know that the value of baht was dropping drastically, by simple dd/ss analysis. If the govt wanted to support the baht, i.e. keep it from dropping, they have to buy back the baht from the market. \n\nBut how? They need to pay using foreign currency. Huge amounts of foreign currency is needed to maintain the fixed exchange rate given how much the baht has depreciated in value. The thai govt does not have enough foreign currency, so it can’t help but let the thai baht float. (This is why the SG govt keeps lots of foreign currency in reserve, for the rainy days.)\n\nPeg to USD. Yes originally, the thai baht was pegged to usd, i.e. the govt has to buy/sell in the forex market to make sure the movements in thai baht follows the movements in USD (keeping the baht/USD exchange rate fixed). As the govt does not have enough foreign reserves, it can no longer do that.\n\nFinancial overextension just means the thai govt had tried to support the thai baht beyond their means. Why did the thai baht depreciate in the first place? Why did people no longer want to hold on to the thai baht? One of the reasons was because the real estate sector had grown gloomy, and many investors pulled away their funds. (Go read up on this!)\n\nThe crisis spread to other countries. Financial contagion is a very interesting phenomenon and there are many reasons for it – probably different reasons for different countries. Some possible explanations are crisis of faith (investors losing confidence in all Asian currencies, having witnessed the failure of the thai govt. so they want to sell the Asian currencies they have on hand, causing all these currencies to depreciate), opportunistic attacks by forex speculators (people who want to make money from people’s economic crises…), structural weakness which were already present in the various Asian economies.\n\nWhy did the Asian economies need bailouts from IMF? Any ideas? Well yes the govts would need to buy back their currencies from the market, and they would also need money to pay back their foreign debts, and they would need stimulation packages for their own economics to restore confidence. Rebuilding confidence, re-attracting investors and discouraging speculators, is key in stabilizing the currencies\n"

Thus, he was retrenched. However, the factory is still there! The spare capacity still exists in the form of an empty factory.\n\nWhen does this become structural unemployment? That only happens when the factory gets knocked down, because Google Glass replaced smartphones. In that case, even if demand increases, Linan will not be able to get a job because there will be no more iPhone factories, and he does not know how to operate the machinery that makes Google glasses.\n\nHence, a good way to check if unemployment is structural is to ask yourself this question: if demand increases, will he get back his job?

    "answer": {
        "content": "Good question! Domestic and international money supply are often confused. When we talk about increasing money supply for monetary (not exchange rate) policy, especially in the case of quantitative easing, we are talking about increasing the domestic money supply.\n\nIt's a good time to answer the second question too. Supply and demand of money in the domestic market affects interest rates. Forex markets affect interest rates in a very indirect and minor way, much less so than supply and demand of money domestically.\n\nSo when the domestic money supply is increased, this lowers the exchange rate through a rather indirect mechanism. Increasing money supply lowers domestic interest rate. This may make the domestic interest rate relatively lower than international interest rate, causing an outflow of short term capital. (Since short term capital always chase higher returns ie. higher interest rates) This increases supply of the currency in the forex (international) market, and causes the exchange rate to depreciate. Hence the lowered exchange rate.\n"

In other words, the every point on the U-shape of each SRAC does not have the same 'ratio' of factors of production and are not different 'sizes' of the same production, and hence cannot be plotted on the axes of the LRAC. Am I misunderstanding something in the video?\n\nb) Next, even if the SRAC curves are taken to be plottable on the LRAC axes, then shouldn't the LRAC curve join all the minimum points of the SRAC curves instead of an envelop of all the SRAC curves? Because let's say we choose one particular size of the factory, then we have a particular SRAC curve. Shouldn't the Variable Factor of production in this case be chosen to minimise the cost, so the production occurs at the minimum cost. Then applying the same logic to all the different sizes of factory and different SRACs, the LRAC should be the locus of all the minimum costs of SRACs, depending on the size of the factory. Or am I misunderstanding something again here?\n\nThank you!",
    "answer": {
        "content": "Great questions! The short answer is that for the SRAC and the LRAC, the x-axis is simply the quantity of goods produced. The second is called Viner's error, and it has got to do with understanding that the LRAC represents the lowest cost at each quantity.\n\nYou're right in understanding that the LRAC represents \"ratios\" of factors of production, and that if we increase them in sync with one another, we get the LRAC. Hence a point on an SRAC that does NOT lie on the LRAC represents a ratio of factors of production that are different from that of the LRAC's. In other words, you can simply draw one \"LRAC\" for every ratio of production there is, and THE LRAC is the lowest one.\n\nAs for the second, imagine it this way. The LRAC shows the minimum cost of production at each quantity. So if you simply draw the minimum point of SRACs, you will not get the minimum at each quantity. Let's look at this diagram.\n\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/or1qoarlgfc9r77/OQ-LRAC.001.png\n\nIf the diagram was drawn using the minimum point of every SRAC, then at point Q, the LRAC should show the minimum cost of all SRACs right? But there is a point on SRAC4 that has lower cost at Q than that of SRAC3. So that point should have been on the LRAC instead. Hence, the only way to draw it is to make the LRAC an envelope, not a locus of minimum points.\n\nIn fact, an economist named Viner once asked his assistant to draw the LRAC as a envelope of minimum points of the SRAC that shows the lowest costs. That proved to be impossible as we have demonstrated, and Viner realized that it was only possible with an the envelope we have shown in the checkpoint."

Why is there a trade off between low unemployment and high inflation?\n\nThanks!",
    "answer": {
        "content": "1. Exchange rates are determined by the demand and supply of your currency in the international market. These demand and supply interactions are driven by factors like the interest rate, actual demand for your country's exports and import quantity. We're assuming that by many exchange rates, you mean the numerous exchange rates with different countries? Well, if Singapore wants to trade with UK, a Singaporean can't simply hand SGD to the UK guy. The UK guy will need British Pounds, so there'll be an exchange rate for that. Extend this to every country you trade with and you have many exchange rates!\n\n2. Theoretically, they are the same interest rate. They are simply determined by the demand and supply of loanable funds, a concept that you don't really have to know for A Levels because it confuses you with domestic money demand and supply. \n\nIn general, your economy has two markets: the real goods and services market and the money market. There is a way to achieve equilibrium in both markets, and that the prevailing interest rate in the money market simply becomes THE interest rate.\n\nRemember how we defined interest rate? It is simply the price of borrowing money, or the returns for parting with money. If you think about that definition, then borrowing and saving should have the same interest rate. By arbitrage, saving and investing should theoretically have the same interest rates as well.\n\nThis doesn't happen in practice because banks actually want to earn profits. :P\n\n3. This is actually not the paradox of thrift. Paradox of thrift happens when everyone tries to save in a recession, thus lowering aggregate demand. When that happens, national income decreases, and people have less income. This in turn lowers overall savings in the economy. Hence even when an individual attempts to save more, everyone saves less as a whole. Hence total savings fall even when each person attempts to save more. \n\nHow does the multiplier work when we save more? Remember the multiplier is computed by 1 / (MPS + MPT + MPM) = 1 / MPW where MPS is Marginal Propensity to Save, MPT is Marginal Propensity for Taxation, MPM is that for import, MPW is that for all withdrawals. By saving more, you are simply increasing MPS. So the fiscal multiplier will simply be less pronounced. That's all!\n\n4. The easiest way to go about doing this is to think about your AD/AS diagram. What happens when you keep increasing your AD to lower unemployment? Eventually your price level will increase right? That's the trade off the Phillip's curve is talking about. Note that this only happens in the intermediate region of your AS. \n"

    "answer": {
        "content": "\nWow that's a lot of questions! But no worries, let's answer them one by one. \n\nThe intutiive way to see how increasing money supply lowers domestic interest rates is to use the liquidity preference curve and the money supply curve (or the domestic demand and supply for money). Assuming that originally we were at equilibrium, then increasing money supply produces surplus money at the given interest rate. The surplus forces the interest rates down.\n\nIt does \"follow\" the central bank's interest rates, but the central bank can't simply stand on a podium and say, \"I want interest rates to be 5%.\" In actual fact, the central bank, if it decides to manipulate interest rates, plays with the money supply in the domestic economy, hence \"deciding\" the interest rate. \n\nYour last statement is kind of true, but let's rephrase it. If more people rush to banks to save money, then banks can afford to get money from people at a lower price. Remember that when you're saving money, you can actually think of it as the bank \"borrowing\" money from you. If there are more people willing to hand money to the banks, then the banks can \"get\" money from you at a cheaper price. Simple as that!"

If the government proceeds to buy up the extra at the prevailing price (which they normally do), then there is overproduction as well. Both happens! The overproduced quantity cannot go to the consumers, since that will lower the price in the market. Hence it is often shipped to third world countries as foreign aid. When the government buys up the surplus, it is actually using its own budget (ie. tax money) to buy up those goods. In other words, the government has to spend additional money. Do factor that into your welfare calculation!\n\nAs for price ceilings, there is underproduction -- while consumers do want to purchase more, they can't at the price of the price ceiling. What the government can do is to create queues, ensure that black markets don't exist etc. Unlike the price floor, the government can't simply \"provide\" for those people who didn't manage to consume the good in the price ceiling situation, simply because the government cannot \"magically conjure\" the goods, and if it were to purchase from the firm itself, it will raise the firm's costs, forcing the price to go up."

Turns out that the Japanese government updates this index every month. \n\nhttp://www.stat.go.jp/english/data/cpi/\n\nThe second question seems simply, but is actually very complex. Even till now, people are still debating the causes of the deflation. However, it is unlikely that businesses are lowering prices to see increases in quantity demanded. More likely, it is a demand side factor, where there simply isn't demand to pull the prices up. Technically, Japan devaluing the Yen will cause inflation (since it prints more Yen), but the really bad state of the economy prevents that from happening. Lack of technical progress contributed to the Japanese slump as well.\n\nYou're right in saying that low prices can attract consumption. However, think about what causes deflation usually. Low economic growth and high spare capacity in the economy causes deflation. In other words, deflation is a sign of an economy with much spare room for growth, but isn't growing. An economy with deflation isn't healthy. In fact, economists have calculated statistically that an inflation of between 1% to 3%. Remember your AD AS curve?

Using this determinant, I can say that healthcare in Singapore is a private good since it is provided by the free market, but I can equally say it's a public good due to government intervention. My notes however argued that it may not be a public good even due to government intervention, since healthcare is a merit good and should be provided for by the government. But this argument also has an issue, because for public goods they are considered merit goods as well (am I right?) which means healthcare can be argued as a public good based on this. But then we notice a distinction between the two, that public good can never be subsidized by the government, only given for free, while the private good can be either subsidized or provided for free. So what exactly is the difference between public and private good based on the determinant of \"mode of provision\"?",

        "content": "Great that you asked! Turns out there's just one little confusion here. Public good does not refer to the \"mode of provision\" of the good. In fact, it has nothing to do with that.\n\nPublic goods are simply goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous. For an explanation of what those two are, check out the videos on openlectures! As a consequence of those two, public goods are commonly produced by the government (or some other smart way is required to facilitate the production of these goods, such as patents). However, this consequence is by no means necessary (though it is very frequent).\n\nYou may have gotten the idea that \"mode of provision\" is the main determinant by the way we introduced the first lecture. We introduced public goods this way because it is easier to find examples of public goods that are provided by the government. Furthermore, it is simpler to visualize than throwing out the concepts non-excludable and non-rivalrous. However, just remember that the two properties are the defining property of public goods!"

        "content": "Remember that positive externalities generates external benefits for third parties due to the production/consumption of a good, without the third party paying or receiving any compensation.\n\nLet's illustrate this idea of underconsumption using the example of education. The presence of external benefits, such as the eventual rising incomes and productivity for current and future generations, leads to a divergence between private benefit and social benefit. Assuming there are no negative externalities, individuals only consider the private benefits of a higher potential income in the future arising from their education - that is, their private benefits. As such, they will only 'consume' education up to the point where MSB = MPC, which is below the socially optimum level. In the pursuit of self-interest as well as imperfect information, consumers, being rational, ignore the positive externalities imposed on society. Since consumption is below the socially optimal level, under-consumption occurs. This results in a deadweight loss which is the net welfare loss imposed on society, as beneficial transactions do not occur.\n\nHope this helps!"

The quantity supplied increases right? That's exactly what the prompt says. Producers digging offshore is a response to the increase in demand, and it shows an increase in quantity supplied (since producers have to go offshore to find oil to supply to the consumers).\n\nGenerally, you only use the profit diagram when analyzing a single firm.

In fact, it is unlikely that it only applies to monopoly. Creative destruction occurs when newer and better methods are developed to replace older ones. In so doing, jobs may be lost and some people may be economically harmed, but this is for the greater good of society. One may find examples of this in every market where innovation occurs, including monopolistic competition.

Not being able to prevent someone from consuming the good (non-excludable) primarily causes free riding.

For example, if there is specialization involved, or a sense that more goods can be produced as one gets into the 'groove' of producing that good, then the PPC will be convex, no? Okay, I can't really think of a good example to illustrate this, but maybe something like, if I have limited time (the resource) to allocate to making, say, econs notes, and making math notes (the two goods). Then obviously, if you use the whole time with your mind focused on one subject, say econs, then your mind will be 'tuned' to think in an econs-sort-of-way, so your total notes made will be more, than say if you multitask end between the two subjects and spent half the time on each.

Traditionally, we only consider the first two.\n\nThe first is only one point on the PPC, but that is not the definition. In fact, the definition arises from the fact that in AE, society produces the right type and amount of goods. One point of the PPC shows that, but so does the intersection of demand and supply (excluding market failures), and when P=MC. Explanations of those are done in openlectures videos.\n\nPE does occur along the border, but means a rather different concept. It simply means that firms are producing at minimum cost. Herein lies the difference in perspective. To the firm, producing at minimum cost simply means producing on the LRAC. To society however, producing at minimum cost means producing at the bottom point of the LRAC (this implies that the firm will need to expand or contract depending on its current location on the LRAC).\n\nX-Efficiency is a rather special concept that we reserve for firms with market power (eg. monopolies).
